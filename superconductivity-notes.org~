* Chapter 2 The BCS theory
** 2.1 Landau Fermi-liquid <2014-02-09 æ—¥>
In a system of fermions, the ground states of the system has its Fermi momentum $\mathbf{p}_F$, which 
is related to the total number of particles N in the system by:
\begin{equation}
N=\sum_{k,s}=\sum_s \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3}\int d^3k=\sum_s \frac{4\pi p_F ^3 V}{3 h^3}
\end{equation}
This equation holds because pauli exclusion principle guarantees that N is just the number of states 
available in the system.
