* TODO Why magnetic field breaks time-reversal symmetry? <2014-02-21 Fri>
[[http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D473995][This]] thread and this [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry][wiki]] entry answer most part of this problem.

The magnetic field is always coupled to the momentum and angular momentum(spin) in the system. When we 
say magnetic field break the TR, we mean the external magnetic field. Under TR, momentum and angular
momentum changes sign, however the external magnetic field doesn't. So we say TR is broken.
