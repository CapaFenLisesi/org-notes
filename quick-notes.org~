* Physics
** Kramers' theorem
Given a Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry, if a state is the Hamiltonian's eigenstate, then its time
reversal state is also an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with the same eigenvalue; besides, the two states 
is orthogonal.

* Linux
** Chrome excute path
    just type =chrome://version= 
** Turn off screen
use =xset dpms force off=
** Custom screen brightness
Install =xbacklight= by using =apt-get install xbacklight=, then set the brightness using 
=xbacklight -set 30=. More convenient way to do is to set shortcuts: =xbacklight -inc 10=
and =xbacklight -dec 10=. Use =xbacklight -get= to see the current brighness.
** Login to ubuntu-2d by default
Config =/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf=, add this line =user-session=ubuntu-2d=. Or use this:
=sudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults -s ubuntu-2d= to set.
** Quick access to folders
Set the environment variable in =.bashrc= files, for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
n="/home/luming/Documents/org/notes/"
cd $n
#+END_SRC
To quick access to current folder, set:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
p=$(pwd)
cd $p
#+END_SRC

** All commands not working 
This is because the environment variable settings, excute this:
=export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin=
will fix the problem.
